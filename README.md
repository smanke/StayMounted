# StayMounted

**Keeps your Mac's network shares mounted, and opens the apps that depend on them.**

macOS forgets file shares all the time. They drop after sleep, when Wi-Fi changes, or when a
NAS reboots, and they are not there after a restart unless you reconnect by hand. Anything that
reads from the share then fails: a media library, a photo catalog, a backup tool, a project
folder. StayMounted is a small menu bar app that notices when an SMB share goes missing and
quietly puts it back. It can also open your apps once the share is there.

## How it works

- **Pick what to keep mounted.** Shares that are mounted now appear in the menu with a
  *Keep Mounted* button. You can also type an address such as `smb://nas.local/Media`.
- **Uses the password you already saved.** StayMounted stores no passwords. It mounts through
  macOS the same way Finder does, using the Keychain entry Finder saved when you ticked
  *Remember this password*. If there isn't one, the share shows *Sign In…*, which opens the
  standard macOS sign-in sheet once.
- **Quiet when you're away.** Before mounting, it checks that the server is answering, so
  being off your home network or VPN never produces error dialogs. It tries again as soon as
  the network changes.
- **Starts at login.** StayMounted turns on *Open at Login* the first time it runs from
  Applications, so your shares are back after every restart. You can turn it off in Settings.

## Features

- **Open apps when a share mounts.** Choose *Open When Mounted…* from a share's ⋯ menu and
  add apps. They open in order every time the share mounts: at login, and again after sleep
  or a network drop. Apps that are already open are left alone. Each app can open hidden, and
  each share can wait a few seconds before opening its apps.
- **Respects Eject.** If you eject a share yourself, a small panel counts down ten seconds
  before remounting it. Its *Keep ejected* button pauses that share until you resume it.
  Shares lost to sleep or a network change come back without asking.
- **Pause anytime.** Pause a single share, or all of them, from the menu.
- **URLs** for ToolHUD, Shortcuts or scripts: `staymounted://mount-all` mounts every missing
  share now, `staymounted://pause` pauses or resumes all of them, and `staymounted://shares`
  shows the shares.
- **Settings in their own window.** Choose **Settings…** from the menu (or press ⌘, while
  StayMounted has a Dock icon) for Open at Login, asking before remounting after an eject,
  where StayMounted appears, settings sync and updates.
- **Dock, menu bar, both or neither.** **Show in Dock** and **Show in menu bar** in Settings
  pick where StayMounted appears. Right-click the Dock icon for **Shares…** or **Settings…**.
  With the menu bar icon off, clicking the Dock icon, or opening StayMounted again from
  Applications or Spotlight, shows your shares in a window.

## Updates

StayMounted checks GitHub for a new release once a day, or as often as you choose in Settings (a number of hours, days, weeks or months).
*When an update is available* in Settings decides what happens:

- **Ask me first** (the default): a notification and *Update to …* in the menu; nothing
  installs until you click it.
- **Install automatically**: the update is downloaded and checked right away, then installed
  once no share is being mounted, no eject is waiting for an answer, no app is presenting or
  keeping the display awake, and the Mac hasn't been used for 2 minutes.
- **Don't check**: *Check for Updates…* in the menu and *Check Now* in Settings still work.

Before installing, StayMounted makes sure the download is signed by the same developer and
notarized by Apple. It updates the app in place, so your settings and permissions carry over.

## Settings sync

Turn on *Sync settings with your other Macs* in Settings and where StayMounted appears,
*Ask before remounting a share I ejected* and the update choice follow you to every Mac on the same
iCloud account, through `iCloud Drive/StayMounted/Settings.plist`. Your watched shares, the
apps they open and their passwords stay on each Mac. A brand-new install that finds this
file turns sync on and starts from your settings.

Updates and settings sync are only in the GitHub build; the App Store build is updated by the
App Store, and its sandbox has no access to iCloud Drive.

## Building

```bash
./build_app.sh            # GitHub build: self-updating, Developer ID signed
./install.sh              # copy to /Applications and launch
./build_app.sh --appstore # sandboxed Mac App Store flavour, updater compiled out
swift test                # unit tests for StayMountedKit
```

`./release.sh <version>` builds, notarizes, packages and publishes a GitHub release.

Diagnostics are written to `~/Library/Logs/StayMounted.log`. Set `STAYMOUNTED_UI_PREVIEW=1`
to open the menu's contents in an ordinary window.
